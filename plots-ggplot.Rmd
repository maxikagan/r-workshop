# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing. 

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```

```{r data1}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
```

```{r first_plot}
ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x=year, y=visitors)) +
  geom_line()
```

After we have made the plot an object, we can add / modify it with geom_*:

```{r base_mod1}
gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x=year, y=visitors))
gg_base + geom_point()
gg_base + geom_col()
gg_base + geom_area()
```
